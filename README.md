# bank_customer_dashboard
 A dashboard with widgets from Holoviz's Panel library.
 
 The aim of creating this dashboard is to work around with Panel library.
 
 "Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text." src: https://panel.holoviz.org/
 
The main code (churn_dash.ipynb) uses dummy data from bank_data.csv. This data was generated via Python script "generate_random_bank_customers_data.py". Comments are included within the .py script.
